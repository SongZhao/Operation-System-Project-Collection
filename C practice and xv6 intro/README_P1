<p>For adding a syscall to xv6 I modify sysproc.c, syscall.h, syscall.c, user.h, usys.s and defs.h. 
Most of the changes are in the sysproc.c. In sysproc.c I added a new function addnum. I think the 
part that should notice is we have to declare an extern int if we want the number to be returned correct.</p>
